15:19:44,584 root INFO I wanted to change an 4 night hotel stay to 2 nights over the same time frame.  The cost on my init is reservation would have been $84 and $169I was told the hotel was sold out but they could cancel and rebook me for 2 nights for $505!  They kept me on the phone for over 40 min while I tried to rectify this and not be over charged.  I got such a run around I finally cancelled the reservation.  As a note: all the early communications said the reservation could be changed with no penalty before 2/28 and I was within the time allowed.  Within hours I saw an email advertisement come through that I could make a reservation again for my requested dates at a rate of $129.  The whole thing was a complete racket!  It cost me time and the hassle of finding another reservation.  I will never use Expedia again

15:19:44,589 root INFO System wasn't holding my AARP number in the box; when I got to the booking confirmation screen it showed a higher price.  This was because system wasn't holding my AARP number when screen changed.  After doing this twice I called your no-customer service call center.  The first time I got a young girl who kept telling me that the flights had changed prices & what the computer showed must be the new price for that flight even though I had gone back into the system & was looking at the same prices that I was trying to book my flight for.  I tried again after my second attempt failed & the man was much more knowledgeable but he wanted to open an "investigation".  I appreciate that but I've worked in a system oriented office & sometimes our 'tickets' took weeks to resolve.  What I wanted was for someone to see that I am actually an AARP member & help me book a flight at the reduced rate.  That was a great big fail for you guys cos you didn't address my needs at all.  Instead, you treated me like I was some crazy old lady who didn't know what was going on.  I will say that I was very ugly to the man that I talked to & I am sorry about that.  I was angry that I had spent a few hours trying to book this flight & I couldn't get it done.  Booking a flight doesn't take that long.  Also, was trying to book this flight for myself & some friends at a certain price so there is the embarrassment factor of having to go back to them & tell them that I couldn't get the price that I thought.

15:19:44,593 root INFO The mechanics of handling the issue was fairly straight forward.  However, the language barrier ( English was not her prime language ) of the customer service rep caused a lot of "pardon me, I didn't understand you" moments. Time spent on the phone was not efficiently managed because of that barrier.  She placed me on extended hold to confer with the hotel in the booking.

On line the difference was not that, but manager would not give me the same rate. She only gave me the option to cancel. I told her I could not since the other charges had gone thru and would have to wait until they cleared and my money returned before making new reservations.

Mo promised that he or someone else would get the information from the hotel on Monday the 26th and call me back.  As of today, March 4, I have not heard anything.  Had I received the follow-through call with a satisfactory result, I would have been much more likely to recommend AARP travel.

I 1st called the hotel mgr. and explained my situation and he said I needed to contact Expedia to try to make any changes. I contacted an Expedia agent and explained to her my sudden need to cancel our trip and she was very sympathetic to our needs. She contacted the hotel manager and came back online to tell me our reservation was cancelled and we would get a refund. She also wished my wife and I a positive outcome for her surgery. We hope we can re-book our trip sometime in June. Thank you all for your understanding and help in resolving our situation.

I spent 1hr 20 mins trying to achieve this and was being told they had “ no” available cars the next day when mine would have been physically sitting there. I even said I didn’t care about paying for the extra day as the alternative was to pay $250 more, for a lesser car, for one less days rental.
I had to escalate it to Marvin who tried to help by using an alternative I provided which was to amend the name on the booking to our friends coming in from the UK.
Upon arrival and 2hrs through immigration there was no car. So we as a group are car less in Barbados at one of their busiest times of the year

They suggested I hold both reservations and to keep checking back to see if what I wanted became available. I decided not to wait, and once the B&B was opened again in the morning, I called them and they were able to make the corrections I needed and they cancelled my duplicate reservation.

When I realized this I called back and the guy I talked to told me there might be a cancellation fee and to hold on.  He came back and said there wasn't. This is months before I would need a car so I feel he was harrassing me.  I asked for an email to confirm the reservation was cancelled.  Never got one.  Called again this last Friday spoke with Joe.  He seemed bothered by me.  He said it was cancelled.  Again I asked for confirmation of this.  To date I have no documented verification that it was cancelled.  Will someone please send me an email to confirm cancellation of this car.  #7334787260705. If I don't get an email I shall have to take this further.  Don't even get me started on you United Health care AARP endorsed.  What a bunch of shady salesmen.  Deceitful and out and out lied about the coverage.  I know your not medical people.  But so far anything I've tried to do through AARP has been a bust.  You really need to investigate the people you endorse.  The people I have dealt with both issues only tell you what they think will make a sale.  Shame on them and shame on you for tolerating them.  Just an FYI the internet has a plethora of complaints for both issues.  Dozens and dozens of people can't all be wrong.

I have called twice, only to get the same answer:oh, that wrong charge will fall of your credit card in a few days......well it has not "fallen" off my credit card. I feel like I am being taken advantage of and not being taken care of. The person I spoke with was very nice, but not helpful. I never expected that from AARP.  I will think long and hard before I use your service again, unless someone can assure me that this matter will be taken care of.

We had to cancel our plans in September because of an unexpected death in the family.  We received refunds for the rental car and the hotel, but were told that there would be no refund for the air fare, only a credit that had to be used by May, 2018.  We realized that we could use the credit by then, so went back to Expedia to get a cash refund.  Expedia referred us to United Refund.  United issued the refund by check to Travelscape.  We waited about a month waiting for the refund to be forwarded to us; never happened. I called Travelscape, they referred us back to "AARP powered by Expedia".  I called them.  Finally, the refund was credited back to my credit card a 2 days ago.  The process was ridiculous.

I called Expedia and explained the situation. Eventually the email came through but it had been made for the incorrect date.  I went through many other questions asked, then finally was told I needed to talk with Expedia through AARP.  So I called them and was asked about all the same questions and through a series of calls between the motel and myself it took over an 1 1/2 hours to get the situation resolved.  To me it was ridiculous that it should take this long, just to switch the date.  In addition, I could hardly understand either one of the Expedia personnel I spoke with.  Their accents were very difficult to understand the information they were attempting to share. When I asked questions of them, I felt they were never answered and all they did was kept saying the same things over and over.  Very poor customer service.  I have always been happy with when Dealing with AARP on matters, so feel this poor service came from Expedia.  If it is someone's job to assist customers with their issues, then the person should at least be able to be understood over the phone!

15:19:44,655 root INFO The customer service reps at both Expedia & AARP  told me that I was getting a discount already in my 'pre-booking price' when this was not at all true.  I had previously done comparison shopping on other websites.  When I asked AARP's help in getting Economy Car Rental to honor the AARP Discount, I was referred to Expedia Cust. Svc.  Expedia said I was 'already getting a discounted rate' which was simply NOT true.  Also, I was additonally charged $11.95/day for my 7 day rental as Economy claimed my auto insurance policy did not carry enough Liability coverage.  There was NO MENTION as to any Liability Coverage requirements prior to my booking the rental. I was simply instructed to bring my auto ins.policy's Declaration Page and that I could use my own auto ins.policy coverage instead.  I DID NOT APPRECIATE the 'Bait & Switch' routine I got when I arrived at the airport.  On top of it, Expedia told me I 'only get a discount on the car rental, not the extra insurance I was required to buy'.  Really?  Where was this 'New Rule'?  My guess is it was made up on the spot like the 'I already got a discount' rule.  I will never again use AARP, Expedia or Economy in booking any car rentals and I will tell EVERYONE ELSE not to do so either.

I called and explained our problem to AARP Travel and they sold our rooms to someone else and gave us a refund.  Our son is still not well but is over the critical stage we think.  We are thankful to AARP Travel for helping reduce the stress in this bad situation.  Donna is heartsick she missed her 45th reunion but would not jeapordize Nathan's recovery for any thing.

I cancelled a reservation for lodging (Travelodge, Holbook, AZ)and Expedia sent me a reservation confirmation email. However, Expedia did not notify Travelodge of the cancellation. Therefor, I was still charged for the room by Travelodge on my VISA. After 2 hours, I finally was transferred to a supervisor named Shannon Mardell and she was great and helped me. This issue should have been fixed quickly (within 10 minutes. Instead I had to argue with an incompetent customer service rep. until 11:30 P.M. at night.

SECOND:  when I tried to pay for the tickets VISA this AARP Fake website took 6 min. to connect with expedia and then with my bank, that's far too long for any banking transaction! You will get hacked! or what if the connection drops dead- you just lost a 600.00 transaction! In the future, just offer a Discount Code in your magazine that people can use on the regular Expedia website and drop this non-functional AARP sudo website! it was even frustration trying to find it in the first place, jou tell it to go back to find your flight or change date and it takes you back to some other page of AARP Benefits!

It did take over 1/2 hr on the phone to accomplish.  Have to say I got a rate $25 less than the supposed discount rate that AARP advertised. That gives me reason to make direct reservations in the future. Also learned hotels give a bereavement rate. Definitely gives some food for thought.

15:19:44,713 root INFO Your rental car online site for Budget rental car is false and misleading. The site gives you the option to exclude insurance, however, in Mexico according to Budget they have mandatory insurance coverage requirements which are not listed on your site. Your site allows a customer to reserve a rental car with Budget without insurance coverage, however, when you arrive at the Budget Mexico office they require insurance coverage I declined on the Expedia website. Additionally, I was informed that if you purchase Expedia’s daily insurance for the car at $11 per day, that coverage is ineffective for Mexico and you still have to obtain insurance through Budget. So you end up purchasing worthless “insurance” from Expedia. FRAUD???

I made a reservation through the website for both of us at a hotel (with very good reviews) close to the event at that time and received a confirmation stating no need to contact hotel as reservation is confirmed.  The other day I went on the website to review our reservation and find no reservation even though I had a confirmation #, so I called.  No reservation was ever made by you.  While the AARP travel rep made another reservation for us, we are now staying at an extremely disgusting poor rated hotel arranged by the AARP travel rep because everything else in the area is NOW sold out. I am well over 70 yrs. & was looking forward to this once in a lifetime father-son trip which we have been looking forward to for months and is now a huge disappointment due to your misleading service. Your inability to follow through on behalf of your customers is non-existent and your credibility is totally unacceptable for being in a service-only provided industry. For these reasons, I can not trust you.  Never again.

15:19:44,723 root INFO I saw a price change and was told it would cost me one night to change my initial booking. When I have dealt withj the hotel directly this was never an issue- i would get the discounted rate. I have used Booking, Priceline and this was never an issue. I even contacted the hotel directly and they said have Expedia call us and we will see.

15:19:44,724 root INFO My phone call to AARP Travel was "one-stop shopping". 
I knew I was getting the best value for my time & money by using AARP Travel. 
I didn't need to bounce between  multiple websites to book my airline, hotel or rental car. The questions I had  were quickly answered  by one person (not having to scroll thru  annoying FAQ's pages). 
Additional services I required (like wheelchair transport & handicapped room), again were easily handled by the AARP travel agent. 
The agent was pleasant and knowledgeable.
Other people may like to waste their time comparing websites... I'd much rather spend my time utilizing  AARP's helpful Travel Services, where I can ask questions and have them quickly and pleasantly answered.

15:19:44,725 root INFO I booked a trip in Feb 2018 to be taken in Nov,2018. It was indicated to me that expedia had a guaranteed price match if I saw a lower price before I embarked on the trip. A few days ago I found a much lower price on Orbitz , a sister site of Expedia. I therefore called the AARP/Expedia site where I booked the original trip. After being on the line over 30 minutes with the agent, she said she would have to transfer me to a supervisor, After a few more minutes she came on the line and cut me off. I then called back and got another agent and had to go through the whole process again and again was transferred to another supervisr. After another 30 minutes she finally told me that the price guarantee was for 24 hours only. I told her that the only thing that I was told about was that I could cancel within 24 hours of booking, nothing was said about the Expedia price guarantee. Of course I was extremely and remain very upset.My itenerary #is 
7330861731730. My name is Henry Ertter, My phone is 803-517-8293. The lower price I found on Orbitz was $824.00 per peron, a difference of over $140.00 from the original booking. Having been a former CEO, President and Vice President of several companies during my career, makes me wonder if your customer service personnel are not trained well or if your price guarantee is not really guaranteed. I would welcome a response from you and the only thing that will satisfy my displeasure would be a refund in the price difference  Thanks, H.F.Ertter

I will warn anyone away from using this horrible "service". Charging me $80.55 for a car rental! or if the other issue is the main issue, then over-charging me. Your receipt did not break out charges for air, hotel and car until I saw it on my Credit Card charges online. I was overcharged on everything but the car rental is charges are HORRENDOUS!

Unfortunately, we had to change our plans and cancel many hotels; some of which did not offer refunds.  This young man successfully got our "non refund" hotels successfully refunded.  He was very patient with me as I gave him a long list of cancellations and date changes.

They took lots of detail discussing what I needed, then proceeded to make the reservation for a wrong hotel.  I confirmed the name and location with the agent, and she confirmed yes to the hotel I needed was the hotel she booked.  Then, when the email confirmation was received, it was the wrong hotel.  I had to go online and cancel the reservation and book the correct hotel.  I waited to receive the confirmation for the cancellation, but never received it.  When I called the hotel they said we were still on the reservation list and suggested we call Expedia.  The agent cancelled and confirmed I had made the reservation correctly on the Expedia web site.  It was nerve wrecking that I might have had to pay two hotels because of the first Expedia agent's neglience and mistake.
