I found out later that statement is not correct the price is already an AARP discounted rate. So I went ahead and reserved a car for $154.00 and the total after fees was $242. I called back to see why it didn't discount at the end, and was told by another AARP travel center employee that it was just certain cars, but he could get me a better deal for $215.

2018-01-03 09:29:59.999997,,"Resolving the problem took two calls and close to an hour of time. Admittedly, it was not a run-of-the-mill problem: I wanted to change the email address on my account and could not because the ""new"" address I wanted to use was one I had used to book a trip as a guest years ago. There was no mechanism for your agent to delete that address from the system. Luckily, the second agent I spoke with said that she could create an account for the one that had been used once, and we did that. This means I will eventually abandon/close the account with the old address and my travel history -- no big deal, I guess.

The only other comment on this problem is that I was told once this time, and also in a previous attempt to solve this problem several years ago, that I could not use the new address anymore.  It was only after I said that this effectively meant that I couldn't use Expedia anymore that the agent came up with the solution of creating an account for the address.",,

I instruct international professional students and all are superior to your personnel with regard to understanding what customers are saying in English.

In order to get a refund (maybe) there are numerous steps we have to go through in order to ""prove"" there was a fall and the spouse can not travel.  All must be accomplished through a physician statement.  I doubt there are many physicians willing to write such a statement but we are going to try.  There should be an easier way to accomplish a name change.  We even asked if there was a fee for a name change and there is none.  This is ridiculous.  What ever happened to customer service and accommodating the customer?

It even said in the fine print along the side of the page that I would need to contact Frontier.com for baggage fees.  I expected that Frontier would give me the lower rate of $25 per bag but rather they said since I had already purchased the tickets it was like showing up at the counter with bags which they charge $38 each for carry on.  You need to have all the options available at the site especially for Frontier because they are notorious for nickle-dime-ing everything. The cost of the ticket was the same on your site as it was on the Frontier site.  Some benefit????,,

Another operator told me I couldn't go to my destination as there were no flights the week I chose. And still the next operator told me there were flights available for that particular week. By far the  worst experience I have ever encountered! I asked at least 9 times to speak to a manager, and was put on hold for 54minutes! Only to have the same operator tell me she couldn't book my flight!! No one would transfer me to a manager! It was seriously the most bizarre, crazy,unreal experience!

I called back 5 minutes later to confirm that the reservation was cancelled, entered the itinerary number and was told by the automated system that the itinerary could not be found.  I concluded that the booking had been cancelled.  Three days later I noticed on my credit card online statement that the ticket charges had been posted as final.  I have called your customer  support organization on January 13, January 15 and again today, January 22, speaking with many different agents including Ashley at corporate Customer care today.  After more than 1 and a half hours on the phone today alone, I was told that because they cannot locate records of my calls in their call logs, I cannot receive a refund on the price of these tickets.  My phone shows I made the two calls I referenced earlier in this note and I explicitly recall (in fact my own notes record) having the interaction with your automated telephone system to cancel and then confirm.

As it turned out somehow the email you had for me was one I NEVER had and I would not have given to AARP. She sent the email to the wrong email and I was under the impression she sent it to my email that I told her what it was. I don’t appreciate sending my name and email to God knows who.

Needless to say I never received my email. I called to ask why and this is where it really started. The second representative made the first one seem like Einstein. After numerous times asking for my email that they have on record which is not mine I asked for a supervisor. After asking for a supervisor many times she finally transferred me to one. I told her what the problem was and she FINALLY resolved the problems they had with my account. I really believe AARP was hacked and info changed

I thought that my AARP membership would be sufficient and when I lost my booking because it took awhile to straighten that out, I phoned the Travel Center for help.  They helped me to create a new booking, but then I realized that I had given them the wrong return date, I had to contact them again and cancel the entire thing.  Sigh.  However, I was able to go on line and do it all myself, correctly, the next day.  (Some of us are too soon old and too late smart :-))",,

2018-02-16 20:21:00.000003,7320054336141,"I received a phone call w/ a voice message but I couldn't understand the message b/c of the sender's (male) heavy accent. Then, I received an email so I called the 800 number to see what it was for. The person (female)was very polite but also had a very strong accent. I finally figured out that our flight had been changed. When I asked the reason for the flight change, she had a very difficult time ""going off script"". To her credit, she asked if I could hold & she obtained the information that I wanted. Again, she was very polite & willing to help me until I received the information that I wanted. The call was very lengthy b/c of a few times that she asked to put me on hold. My concern was if the flight was cancelled or just our seats were transferred to another flight b/c my son & family is flying on the same flight. While talking w/ her I was able to text my son & he did get a notice that he was rebooked on the flight that we were being rebooked on. He also got a notice that the flight going was changed, but I never got that notice nor was it mentioned by the person helping me. So, I went directly to my AA page & saw the change. Now, I will also have to change the times for our car rental which I have not done yet. I know that most corporations use ESL (English as a second language) persons for their calls. I tutor ESL students! I am an advocate for them. But, in business & travel matters, it's hard to have a language barrier. It tends to be complicated enough!",,

My AARP agent called then to see what could be done, at first they said they would not cancel my confirmed stay.  The AARP agent called me back and told me; however, because of what the hotel stated they provided for its guests, the AARP agent asked the hotel if they would be able to match everything they advertised.  The hotel changed their mind and canceled my stay.  However, I was told that it would take a week to refund my credit card.  At this time I am waiting for this to happen.  I will never agree to a confirmed stay again because of this situation and will track down hotel feedback in the future.

I understood the airlines not refunding but crediting the amount for tickets, to be used at a later booking with a 200.00 change fee per ticket.  I booked a trip for this May, but after speaking with my employer, I was asked not to go at that time.  I called within the 24 hours of booking the flight, which used my credit with the airlines.  I was told that Expedia could not void the transaction for the change fee and additional amount for the fare on my ticket.  I was told to call the airline and that it was their policy.  I was on the phone for two and a half hours and was being told to call expedia by the airlines and then call united airlines by expedia.  I was told that if I had book the trip for May directly through the airlines, they would have been able to void the transaction, but because expedia was involved they could do nothing other than issue another credit and not for the full amount I had paid. I addition, I would have to pay another 200.00 per ticket change fee to use the ticket.  Mind you, this was about ten hours after I had booked the flight!  I will not book through Expedia again.  Too many rules between the airlines and expedia.
