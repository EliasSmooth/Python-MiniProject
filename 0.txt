I said great and when I got the confirmation it was $215.00 and after fees $312.00,better deal, HUH?

16:00:45,908 root INFO Resolving the problem took two calls and close to an hour of time. Admittedly, it was not a run-of-the-mill problem: I wanted to change the email address on my account and could not because the "new" address I wanted to use was one I had used to book a trip as a guest years ago. There was no mechanism for your agent to delete that address from the system. Luckily, the second agent I spoke with said that she could create an account for the one that had been used once, and we did that. This means I will eventually abandon/close the account with the old address and my travel history -- no big deal, I guess.

The only other comment on this problem is that I was told once this time, and also in a previous attempt to solve this problem several years ago, that I could not use the new address anymore.  It was only after I said that this effectively meant that I couldn't use Expedia anymore that the agent came up with the solution of creating an account for the address.

16:00:45,925 root INFO It was difficult because the individual I was speaking with, though kind and courteous, was quite hard to understand.  Due to his accent.  Though I was referred to this individual in order to rebook a cancelled flight he was not able to help me directly but needed to check in with others at least twice.  I feel I should be given a monetary credit for my cancelled flight to use at my own discretion scheduling another flight.  In addition, while my original flight cost a little over $900, the flight this individual found for me was over $4000.  THAT is ridiculous!
I travel fairly frequently and recently I have found absolutely no advantage to arranging flights through AARP Travel Center.

Every time I called AARP/Expedia I was basically given the same runaround...."the manager at the hotel is not available at this time but we have a left a message and will follow up with him tomorrow and someone will get back to you".  Then I would have to call you again and go through the same process all over again.  I FINALLY got the last charge removed by calling my credit card company and turning it over to their fraud department.  I can't even begin to tell you how much time I spent on the phone trying to get this mess cleared up.  I DID NOT book these rooms and have absolutely no idea why this happened but it should have been an easy fix on your end.  And it wasn't.  And to have someone tell me that it was perhaps my fault because when I was looking at rooms on-line I may have "accidently" booked them is ridiculous.  I have used your website in the past and know how it works.  I can say that I don't feel confident in using your services again due to the fact that I received such terrible customer service.

I spoke with an Expedia rep who was helpful and able to provide a partial refund but it took a couple of phone calls and 90 minutes to resolve which was difficult with two exhausted kids at the airport.  Based on Yelp reviews, Payless appears to upcharge frequently and I wonder if you should investigate and rethink your partnership with them if in fact the customer service they provide is truly as bad as the reviews (and our experience) suggest

I was told the system was "refreshing" and that I needed to try again the next day. Did that. It still didn't work. So I called again and had to spend over an hour trying to work with a CS person to place my request over the phone. It was extremely frustrating because her accent was so heavy that I could barely understand her. She knew her stuff and was very patient with me but she was also having trouble with the system. We never did get my 5th excursion booked. So, fix the system and get people who speak English without an accent in the  Customer Service department,please!

I cancelled my original reservation, contacted Hertz, extended by SIX days and I'm paying less than the original reservation. I understand that the rate system is not a reflection of EXpedia or AARP. My problem is the disparity in agents and their willingness to help...Kudos to Agents 1&3.

After several hours of trying to resolve this, we took the lesser of two evils and booked the extra days.  Nobody could explain why this happened.  I asked to speak to a manager, and after another long hold, I was connected to an extremely rude woman who clearly didn’t care about the customer.  I have been a customer in the past, and I even have an upcoming trip already booked.  Thankfully after my husband ran out of patience,  I took over.  He was and still is livid.

16:00:45,974 root INFO I had multiple bookings and cancellations and had large errors made every single time I made a change. Took multiple calls to fix every problem. It should have taken 1 call instead it took 3 or 4. None of the service people had English as a first language so they must not have understood at all what I was asking. I instruct international professional students and all are superior to your personnel with regard to understanding what customers are saying in English. It also does no good for them to lie, giving an English “name” when they are obviously not a primary English speaker. If they are Mohammad they should not call themself “Mike”. I will never use the AARP travel service again. Terrible experience.

16:00:45,979 root INFO my spouse is unable to travel on this booked vacation due to a fall which he sustained a broken hip and might develop blood clots with sitting for such a lengthy time.  The original call was for a name change on the ticket due to my daughter in law accepting the invitation to travel with me.  This can not happen I found out because of airline restrictions.  In order to get a refund (maybe) there are numerous steps we have to go through in order to "prove" there was a fall and the spouse can not travel.  All must be accomplished through a physician statement.  I doubt there are many physicians willing to write such a statement but we are going to try.  There should be an easier way to accomplish a name change.  We even asked if there was a fee for a name change and there is none.  This is ridiculous.  What ever happened to customer service and accommodating the customer?  No other alternatives are available said the customer service representative as she read off the statement about how to cancel the ticket.  Didn't want a canceled ticket--wanted a name change to go on a vacation.  Life happens--this should not be this difficult.

16:00:46,6 root INFO I had to spend an additional $26 for baggage fees ($38 vice $25 each) on the Frontier website because your AARP/Expedia website did not give me the option of baggage fee and seat selection purchase during the time of ticket purchase on the AARP site.  It even said in the fine print along the side of the page that I would need to contact Frontier.com for baggage fees.  I expected that Frontier would give me the lower rate of $25 per bag but rather they said since I had already purchased the tickets it was like showing up at the counter with bags which they charge $38 each for carry on.  You need to have all the options available at the site especially for Frontier because they are notorious for nickle-dime-ing everything. The cost of the ticket was the same on your site as it was on the Frontier site.  Some benefit????

Ninety percent of that was spent being transferred from department to department and on hold. I was told by one of your representatives it would cost me $1000 more for the tickets ! When the next person I spoke to told me it would be $80 more. Another operator told me I couldn't go to my destination as there were no flights the week I chose. And still the next operator told me there were flights available for that particular week. By far the  worst experience I have ever encountered! I asked at least 9 times to speak to a manager, and was put on hold for 54minutes! Only to have the same operator tell me she couldn't book my flight!! No one would transfer me to a manager! It was seriously the most bizarre, crazy,unreal experience! I will never,ever use AARP travel center powered by Expedia again! I will never renew my AARP membership! Shame on you AARP for being affiliated with Expedia. I will never recommend your organization to anyone! My experience was a total nightmare!

16:00:46,16 root INFO I made reservation on January 10 and after receiving the reservation confirmation email I realized that I had made an error in my reservation. Within an hour of initially making the reservation and within minutes after having received the confirming email I called 800-675-4318 and followed the prompts to cancel the reservation.  I called back 5 minutes later to confirm that the reservation was cancelled, entered the itinerary number and was told by the automated system that the itinerary could not be found.  I concluded that the booking had been cancelled.  Three days later I noticed on my credit card online statement that the ticket charges had been posted as final.  I have called your customer  support organization on January 13, January 15 and again today, January 22, speaking with many different agents including Ashley at corporate Customer care today.  After more than 1 and a half hours on the phone today alone, I was told that because they cannot locate records of my calls in their call logs, I cannot receive a refund on the price of these tickets.  My phone shows I made the two calls I referenced earlier in this note and I explicitly recall (in fact my own notes record) having the interaction with your automated telephone system to cancel and then confirm. I can't explain why your logs don't show that I called, but I did. I am most displeased by Expedia's denying my request for a refund.

16:00:46,24 root INFO My travel plans changed so I wanted to cancel a reservation. I tried to do it online but the site was unresponsive. I called customer service and was told to wait on hold. I gave up after about 10 minutes. I was told I'd get a callback if I was disconnected but never did.  I called again. Same experience. After 10 minutes the rep told me they couldn't figure out how to cancel my reservation either but, since I hadn't given a credit card number with the reservation, cancellation wasn't necessary. Poor service.

16:00:46,25 root INFO The first representative I had to deal with in my opinion is intellectually challenged. I made a hotel reservation with her and asked for a email confirmation. I asked if she had my email address and told her at least once, probably twice what it is and she said they have it. As it turned out somehow the email you had for me was one I NEVER had and I would not have given to AARP. She sent the email to the wrong email and I was under the impression she sent it to my email that I told her what it was. I don’t appreciate sending my name and email to God knows who.

Needless to say I never received my email. I called to ask why and this is where it really started. The second representative made the first one seem like Einstein. After numerous times asking for my email that they have on record which is not mine I asked for a supervisor. After asking for a supervisor many times she finally transferred me to one. I told her what the problem was and she FINALLY resolved the problems they had with my account. I really believe AARP was hacked and info changed

I can’t say enough good things about the supervisor. She knew I was really angry and she resolved the issues.

However, your vendors (ie Airlines and Hotels/Motels) were not very cooperative and helpful in solving Medical Issues that prevented me from Traveling as originally planned. I was hospitalized with a PI (Pulmanary Imbolisum) blood clot in my lungs that prevented me from traveling until fully recovered. I needed to Cancel my itinerary #0067034404193 and requested a refund due to limited financial resources. One Airline and the Hotel refused to give me a Refund now I am out not only the Hospital Cost and related expenses but over $615.25 for the travel cost. This is very poor customer Service on your Vendors and individuals should be allowed to at least credit their trip if not refund due to medical problems. You are dealing with a older portion of the population. Vendors like these should not be able to provide service to your Members.

As a note: all the early communications said the reservation could be changed with no penalty before 2/28 and I was within the time allowed.  Within hours I saw an email advertisement come through that I could make a reservation again for my requested dates at a rate of $129.  The whole thing was a complete racket!

16:00:46,443 root INFO System wasn't holding my AARP number in the box; when I got to the booking confirmation screen it showed a higher price.  This was because system wasn't holding my AARP number when screen changed.  After doing this twice I called your no-customer service call center.  The first time I got a young girl who kept telling me that the flights had changed prices & what the computer showed must be the new price for that flight even though I had gone back into the system & was looking at the same prices that I was trying to book my flight for.  I tried again after my second attempt failed & the man was much more knowledgeable but he wanted to open an "investigation".  I appreciate that but I've worked in a system oriented office & sometimes our 'tickets' took weeks to resolve.  What I wanted was for someone to see that I am actually an AARP member & help me book a flight at the reduced rate.  That was a great big fail for you guys cos you didn't address my needs at all.  Instead, you treated me like I was some crazy old lady who didn't know what was going on.  I will say that I was very ugly to the man that I talked to & I am sorry about that.  I was angry that I had spent a few hours trying to book this flight & I couldn't get it done.  Booking a flight doesn't take that long.  Also, was trying to book this flight for myself & some friends at a certain price so there is the embarrassment factor of having to go back to them & tell them that I couldn't get the price that I thought.

I do not plan to use AARP Travel again based on the poor service by the recommended car rental agency.  Payless Car rental should be taken off the referral list.

16:00:46,449 root INFO The mechanics of handling the issue was fairly straight forward.  However, the language barrier ( English was not her prime language ) of the customer service rep caused a lot of "pardon me, I didn't understand you" moments. Time spent on the phone was not efficiently managed because of that barrier.  She placed me on extended hold to confer with the hotel in the booking.  I am confident the hotel rep  had the same problem which likely contributed to the extended time I was left on hold.

BLvd Las Vegas, she booked me in another hotel and sold me insurance in case of any trouble. I called Vegas myself after hanging up with Cathy only to find out there is Wynn hotel and immediately called back to change only hotel not flight and was told it would be $227.00 more for booking at the new hotel. On line the difference was not that, but manager would not give me the same rate. She only gave me the option to cancel. I told her I could not since the other charges had gone thru and would have to wait until they cleared and my money returned before making new reservations. I was stuck with having to pay the extra money instead!!!! DIFFICLT!!!!

Mo promised that he or someone else would get the information from the hotel on Monday the 26th and call me back.  As of today, March 4, I have not heard anything.  Had I received the follow-through call with a satisfactory result, I would have been much more likely to recommend AARP travel.

I 1st called the hotel mgr. and explained my situation and he said I needed to contact Expedia to try to make any changes. I contacted an Expedia agent and explained to her my sudden need to cancel our trip and she was very sympathetic to our needs. She contacted the hotel manager and came back online to tell me our reservation was cancelled and we would get a refund. She also wished my wife and I a positive outcome for her surgery. We hope we can re-book our trip sometime in June. Thank you all for your understanding and help in resolving our situation.

16:00:46,488 root INFO I had to push my rental out by a day because flights were canceled on the US East Coast due to inclement.
I spent 1hr 20 mins trying to achieve this and was being told they had “ no” available cars the next day when mine would have been physically sitting there. I even said I didn’t care about paying for the extra day as the alternative was to pay $250 more, for a lesser car, for one less days rental.
I had to escalate it to Marvin who tried to help by using an alternative I provided which was to amend the name on the booking to our friends coming in from the UK.
Upon arrival and 2hrs through immigration there was no car. So we as a group are car less in Barbados at one of their busiest times of the year

I wanted to make a change to my itinerary and the site rejected my changes asking me to try again. I finally had to contact customer service. They were experiencing the same issues and created another reservation for me. They were unable to obtain the same price as the original reservation. They suggested I hold both reservations and to keep checking back to see if what I wanted became available. I decided not to wait, and once the B&B was opened again in the morning, I called them and they were able to make the corrections I needed and they cancelled my duplicate reservation.

When I realized this I called back and the guy I talked to told me there might be a cancellation fee and to hold on.  He came back and said there wasn't. This is months before I would need a car so I feel he was harrassing me.  I asked for an email to confirm the reservation was cancelled.  Never got one.  Called again this last Friday spoke with Joe.  He seemed bothered by me.  He said it was cancelled.  Again I asked for confirmation of this.  To date I have no documented verification that it was cancelled.  Will someone please send me an email to confirm cancellation of this car.  #7334787260705. If I don't get an email I shall have to take this further.  Don't even get me started on you United Health care AARP endorsed.  What a bunch of shady salesmen.  Deceitful and out and out lied about the coverage.  I know your not medical people.  But so far anything I've tried to do through AARP has been a bust.  You really need to investigate the people you endorse.  The people I have dealt with both issues only tell you what they think will make a sale.  Shame on them and shame on you for tolerating them.  Just an FYI the internet has a plethora of complaints for both issues.  Dozens and dozens of people can't all be wrong.

16:00:46,510 root INFO When I used your booking service, I was not issued a United Ticket that I ordered on line.  However,I was charged for a non-existent ticket.  I had to rebook my flight was a higher cost. I am being charged for 2 tickets on the same plane. I want the extra ticket fee taken off my charge card. I have called twice, only to get the same answer:oh, that wrong charge will fall of your credit card in a few days......well it has not "fallen" off my credit card. I feel like I am being taken advantage of and not being taken care of. The person I spoke with was very nice, but not helpful. I never expected that from AARP.  I will think long and hard before I use your service again, unless someone can assure me that this matter will be taken care of.

We had to cancel our plans in September because of an unexpected death in the family.  We received refunds for the rental car and the hotel, but were told that there would be no refund for the air fare, only a credit that had to be used by May, 2018.  We realized that we could use the credit by then, so went back to Expedia to get a cash refund.  Expedia referred us to United Refund.  United issued the refund by check to Travelscape.  We waited about a month waiting for the refund to be forwarded to us; never happened. I called Travelscape, they referred us back to "AARP powered by Expedia".  I called them.  Finally, the refund was credited back to my credit card a 2 days ago.  The process was ridiculous.

I called Expedia and explained the situation. Eventually the email came through but it had been made for the incorrect date.  I went through many other questions asked, then finally was told I needed to talk with Expedia through AARP.  So I called them and was asked about all the same questions and through a series of calls between the motel and myself it took over an 1 1/2 hours to get the situation resolved.  To me it was ridiculous that it should take this long, just to switch the date.  In addition, I could hardly understand either one of the Expedia personnel I spoke with.  Their accents were very difficult to understand the information they were attempting to share. When I asked questions of them, I felt they were never answered and all they did was kept saying the same things over and over.  Very poor customer service.  I have always been happy with when Dealing with AARP on matters, so feel this poor service came from Expedia.  If it is someone's job to assist customers with their issues, then the person should at least be able to be understood over the phone!

16:00:46,536 root INFO The customer service reps at both Expedia & AARP  told me that I was getting a discount already in my 'pre-booking price' when this was not at all true.  I had previously done comparison shopping on other websites.  When I asked AARP's help in getting Economy Car Rental to honor the AARP Discount, I was referred to Expedia Cust. Svc.  Expedia said I was 'already getting a discounted rate' which was simply NOT true.  Also, I was additonally charged $11.95/day for my 7 day rental as Economy claimed my auto insurance policy did not carry enough Liability coverage.  There was NO MENTION as to any Liability Coverage requirements prior to my booking the rental. I was simply instructed to bring my auto ins.policy's Declaration Page and that I could use my own auto ins.policy coverage instead.  I DID NOT APPRECIATE the 'Bait & Switch' routine I got when I arrived at the airport.  On top of it, Expedia told me I 'only get a discount on the car rental, not the extra insurance I was required to buy'.  Really?  Where was this 'New Rule'?  My guess is it was made up on the spot like the 'I already got a discount' rule.  I will never again use AARP, Expedia or Economy in booking any car rentals and I will tell EVERYONE ELSE not to do so either.

I have an expedia-aarp AND an expedia login, both with the same email and password. AT THIS TIME one cannot see the other in your purchased TRIPS so that was the issue. I had booked a hotel with one and all my airfare with the other. NO PROBLEM but as a computer professional, I was surprised and am currently working on a patch for that for you all.

16:00:46,563 root INFO I spent over 2 hours with AARP/Expedia customer service to fix an error caused by Expedia. I cancelled a reservation for lodging (Travelodge, Holbook, AZ)and Expedia sent me a reservation confirmation email. However, Expedia did not notify Travelodge of the cancellation. Therefor, I was still charged for the room by Travelodge on my VISA. After 2 hours, I finally was transferred to a supervisor named Shannon Mardell and she was great and helped me. This issue should have been fixed quickly (within 10 minutes. Instead I had to argue with an incompetent customer service rep. until 11:30 P.M. at night.  How about a little TLC for an abused AARP member and a frequent traveler!

SECOND:  when I tried to pay for the tickets VISA this AARP Fake website took 6 min. to connect with expedia and then with my bank, that's far too long for any banking transaction! You will get hacked! or what if the connection drops dead- you just lost a 600.00 transaction! In the future, just offer a Discount Code in your magazine that people can use on the regular Expedia website and drop this non-functional AARP sudo website! it was even frustration trying to find it in the first place, jou tell it to go back to find your flight or change date and it takes you back to some other page of AARP Benefits! This website and who sold it to you should be canned! You are losing Millions!

However, the direct phone number to the hotel is not provided and I had to go through the AARP operator in order to get that number. I was unsure about whether I would need to change the hotel so I needed the direct phone number.

I tried again around 930 pm, i got through and was able to make my changes. I am woken up at 230 am CST telling me that this was the return call i had requested. 5 hours is NOT 1.5 hours!! Why does your recording say that i wouldn’t lose my place in line, yet i got through on a second attempt within the hour, but your system decides to wake me up 5 hours later.

It did take over 1/2 hr on the phone to accomplish.  Have to say I got a rate $25 less than the supposed discount rate that AARP advertised. That gives me reason to make direct reservations in the future. Also learned hotels give a bereavement rate. Definitely gives some food for thought.

16:00:46,613 root INFO Your rental car online site for Budget rental car is false and misleading. The site gives you the option to exclude insurance, however, in Mexico according to Budget they have mandatory insurance coverage requirements which are not listed on your site. Your site allows a customer to reserve a rental car with Budget without insurance coverage, however, when you arrive at the Budget Mexico office they require insurance coverage I declined on the Expedia website. Additionally, I was informed that if you purchase Expedia’s daily insurance for the car at $11 per day, that coverage is ineffective for Mexico and you still have to obtain insurance through Budget. So you end up purchasing worthless “insurance” from Expedia. FRAUD???

I made a reservation through the website for both of us at a hotel (with very good reviews) close to the event at that time and received a confirmation stating no need to contact hotel as reservation is confirmed.  The other day I went on the website to review our reservation and find no reservation even though I had a confirmation #, so I called.  No reservation was ever made by you.  While the AARP travel rep made another reservation for us, we are now staying at an extremely disgusting poor rated hotel arranged by the AARP travel rep because everything else in the area is NOW sold out. I am well over 70 yrs. & was looking forward to this once in a lifetime father-son trip which we have been looking forward to for months and is now a huge disappointment due to your misleading service. Your inability to follow through on behalf of your customers is non-existent and your credibility is totally unacceptable for being in a service-only provided industry. For these reasons, I can not trust you.  Never again.

16:00:46,628 root INFO I booked a trip in Feb 2018 to be taken in Nov,2018. It was indicated to me that expedia had a guaranteed price match if I saw a lower price before I embarked on the trip. A few days ago I found a much lower price on Orbitz , a sister site of Expedia. I therefore called the AARP/Expedia site where I booked the original trip. After being on the line over 30 minutes with the agent, she said she would have to transfer me to a supervisor, After a few more minutes she came on the line and cut me off. I then called back and got another agent and had to go through the whole process again and again was transferred to another supervisr. After another 30 minutes she finally told me that the price guarantee was for 24 hours only. I told her that the only thing that I was told about was that I could cancel within 24 hours of booking, nothing was said about the Expedia price guarantee. Of course I was extremely and remain very upset.My itenerary #is 
7330861731730. My name is Henry Ertter, My phone is 803-517-8293. The lower price I found on Orbitz was $824.00 per peron, a difference of over $140.00 from the original booking. Having been a former CEO, President and Vice President of several companies during my career, makes me wonder if your customer service personnel are not trained well or if your price guarantee is not really guaranteed. I would welcome a response from you and the only thing that will satisfy my displeasure would be a refund in the price difference  Thanks, H.F.Ertter

I will warn anyone away from using this horrible "service". Charging me $80.55 for a car rental! or if the other issue is the main issue, then over-charging me. Your receipt did not break out charges for air, hotel and car until I saw it on my Credit Card charges online. I was overcharged on everything but the car rental is charges are HORRENDOUS! What a rip-off and shame on you!

16:00:46,637 root INFO The young man I worked with was exceptional.  We had made several reservations in anticipation of a long road trip.  Unfortunately, we had to change our plans and cancel many hotels; some of which did not offer refunds.  This young man successfully got our "non refund" hotels successfully refunded.  He was very patient with me as I gave him a long list of cancellations and date changes.
I am most happy with ARRP Travel thanks to this man.  I only wish I'd thought to get his name.

16:00:46,638 root INFO I could not get any success online with AARP Expedia, so call AARP Expedia.  They took lots of detail discussing what I needed, then proceeded to make the reservation for a wrong hotel.  I confirmed the name and location with the agent, and she confirmed yes to the hotel I needed was the hotel she booked.  Then, when the email confirmation was received, it was the wrong hotel.  I had to go online and cancel the reservation and book the correct hotel.  I waited to receive the confirmation for the cancellation, but never received it.  When I called the hotel they said we were still on the reservation list and suggested we call Expedia.  The agent cancelled and confirmed I had made the reservation correctly on the Expedia web site.  It was nerve wrecking that I might have had to pay two hotels because of the first Expedia agent's neglience and mistake.
